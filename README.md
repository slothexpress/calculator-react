# Web Calculator

This frontend web application is my first React project.

Cred to this video tutorial on [Web Dev Simplified](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgRrrOt0Vr8).

## try it out in the browser

I chose to test a manual deploy on Netlify:

https://blue-cake-and-purple-buttons.netlify.app/

## try it out on your machine

In a terminal, or the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.

## react build

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.

Your app (the build folder) is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
